# An open-ended application designed to measure and compare time required to perform various operations on similar assortments of data grouped into different Java collections.



To do:
1. Make the information printing more concise and more standardized.
2. Change the initialization and make the ATestingEnviorement superclass abstract.
3. Refine Set timing functionality. 
4. Add remaining list, map and set classes.
5. Add populate() functionality to constructors?
6. Save output to files?
7. Add a functionality to compare time required for identical or similar operations of different types of collections (i. e. desplaying time required to add an object as the last or first element of the collection for ones that allow it).
